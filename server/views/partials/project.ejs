     <h4 style="position: absolute; top:300px; left: 900px;"> -->     I have done this project during graduation and in group of 
        4 students. So firstly I had done many research for what we were going to use in this project. Even I had never studded the 
        image processing and deep learning, so first of all I had learnt basic concepts of image processing and how we can apply it. 
        My duty was about image processing, so me and my another friend  collected whole data of animal for detecting them, and then 
        implemented that into image processing system so by that we were able to identifies different animal. So this was what I did
        in this project, in short.

      <h4 style="position: absolute; top:2100px; left: 900px;"> --> I have done this project in the second semester while graduation.
         I had done that project in a group of 2 person. We did this project in an electronic subject project. I had done practical
          part in this project and my partner did documentation part.</h4>

      <h1 style="position: absolute; top: 2450px; left: 20px; color: rgb(228, 231, 33);">3) Project-3 : hostel managment system:- </h1>
      <h4 style="position: absolute; top:2550px; left: 100px;"> --> I have done this project in the last semester of graduation
         for software design. I had done this project in a group of 3 person. In this project, we just have to do documentation 
         no coding, no prototype. In this project I drew many diagrams like use-case diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram, etc.
         I also done researching part like how we can make it more useful app. Like by adding which function we can reduce efforts 
         of students and hostel management team.  </h4>
